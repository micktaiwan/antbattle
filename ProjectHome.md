# Ant Battle Programming Game #

### What ###

Create a **network client** in your favorite programming language to beat other clients. The players are **computer programs** controlled by the program you wrote.

This projet gives you an AI programming platform. What we provide is a TCP Server creating a virtual board. You have to write a TCP client that connects to the server that controls some entities called 'ants'. These ants have to be somewhat intelligent and evolves in this board. We also provide a graphic interface.

What you need is to know a programming language (we do not impose it, but you have to conform to the network protocol described in the documentation) and be able to write a TCP client.

As today the game is fully functional. You can move your ants, attack, create maps with obstacles, and configure (not all yet) the server options.

In the future, we'd like to create a real multiplayer world, where all the players are robots. Tired of SecondLife, or any other metaverses. We want a world of Artificial Intelligences.
